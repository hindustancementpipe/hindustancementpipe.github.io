RCC (Reinforced Cement Concrete) Collars are used for joining two plain-ended RCC pipes. These collars help maintain pipe alignment, prevent leakage, and ensure a secure connection over long distances. The use of collars allows flexibility and ease of repair or replacement.

Collar joint pipes are best suited where conventional laying techniques are used and where high joint flexibility isn't required.
