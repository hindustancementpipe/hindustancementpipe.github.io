These tanks are used where there is no availability of underground drainage facilities for flushed type of water closets.

Certain anaerobic bacteria flourish in the absence of free oxygen and where humidity, darkness and warmth prevail. These bacteria convert human excreta into gaseous and liquefied state by certain biological and chemical actions.

Heavier matter sinks down and forms “sludge” in a septic tank, the light matter forms a thick layer at the “scum” at the top surface. It is necessary that the layers of sludge and scum remain undisturbed. A septic tank must be initially filled with water, disinfection kills bacteria and obstructs the functioning of septic tanks.
